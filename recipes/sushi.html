            <li>Once the rice is cooked, scoop the rice to a large mixing 
            bowl, and <em>avoid scraping burnt ones at the bottom.</em></li>
            <li>Pour the sushi vinegar over the spatula onto the rice, shifting
            the spatula left and right <br/>
            at the same time to evenly 
            distribute the liquid onto the rice.</li>
            <li>Mix them by slicing the rice with the spatula, break down 
            large chuncks to make sure they are all covered with the 
            sushi vinegar.</li>
            <li>Set aside with a <em>clean cloth</em> covering the bowl to avoid the 
            sushi rice getting stale and keep the steam in.</li>

        <h3><em>Q&amp;A</em></h3>
        
        
        <p><strong><em>Can I use any rice for sushi rice?</em></strong></p>
        <p>Not really, you always want short grain rice to make sushi as 
        short grain rice contains more starch and will help your sushi 
        stick together!</p>

        <p><strong><em>So what's the difference of sushi rice and normal rice?</em></strong></p>
        <p>The type of rice grain, and sushi vinegar in sushi makes a 
        lot of difference! 
        <br/>Short grain is used for sushi instead of long grains,
        which usually appears in Chinese cuisines. 
        <br/>The sushi vinegar
        also gives a faint combination of sweet, salty, and acidic flavour 
        making the rice more appetizing.</p>

        <p><strong><em>How important it is to cover the bowl of mixed sushi rice with a cloth?</em></strong></p>
        <p>So...I did forget putting one on once I was making sushi. 
        I didn't notice at first, and while I was busy rolling and 
        assembling the sushi, 
        <br/>the rice goes from fresh steamy moisture filled 
        warm rice into a pile of stale rice, it's still fine to eat, just a
        little bit of a waste if you know what I mean. 
        <br/>So summary of the above story is, always remember to cover your
        freshly made sushi rice with a clean cloth!</p>
